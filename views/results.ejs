        <h1>Tree Tomato Care</h1>
        <img class="plant-img" src=<%=image%> alt=<%=plant[0].name +'_image_not_found'%>
        <p><strong>Watering:</strong> Tree tomato should be watered deeply and thoroughly about once a week during the
            growing season. In summer, the plant may need to be watered more frequently when the weather is particularly
            hot and dry. In winter, the water requirements of the tree tomato can be reduced to around once every 2
            weeks. Soil should be kept moist but not wet; if it continually remains wet, the plant is vulnerable to
            certain fungal diseases. When watering, check that the soil is completely saturated and that the water is
            able to freely drain out of the bottom of the pot.</p>

        <p><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Tree tomato plants need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight every day for healthy
            growth and to produce fruit. From April to August, when the days are long and the sun is at its strongest,
            it is best for the plants to get at least 8 hours of sunlight each day. In the late fall and winter months,
            when days are shorter and there is less light available, only 4-5 hours of direct sunlight per day is ideal
            for tree tomatoes. To maximize fruit production, it is best to place the plant where there is abundant
            sunlight throughout the day, such as an open field or a south-facing window, and avoid areas of the garden or
            home where the plant will be in shade for most of the day.</p>

        <p><strong>Pruning:</strong> Tree tomatoes should be pruned just before they start fruiting. Pruning is done by
            selectively removing any crossing branches, branches that extend away from the main stem, and any leaves and
            fruit that is infected or disease-prone. Generally, only about 20% of the total canopy should be pruned. The
            branches should be pruned close to the main stem, and cutting just above or below the node is recommended.
            Pruning helps to promote growth and should be done when the tree is in an active growth cycle, which is
            usually in spring or early summer. Pruning before fruiting also helps to increase the amount of fruit
            produced.</p>

        <h1>Coneflower (Echinacea 'Tomato Soup') Care</h1>
        <img class="plant-img" src="../images/image.png" alt="Coneflower">
        <p><strong>Watering:</strong> Coneflower typically prefers a moist soil to promote growth. Water deeply when the
            top 2”–3” (5–7.5 cm) of the soil has dried out. During the first few weeks after planting, you'll want to
            check the soil more frequently to ensure it's not drying out too quickly. If you experience a dry spell,
            make sure you water your coneflower deeply, providing the plant with 1” (2.5 cm) of water per week. Water
            in the morning to give the plant the entire day to dry off, which can help to prevent fungal problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Coneflower plants perform best in full sun, meaning they need 6 to 8 hours of
            direct sunlight per day. During the summer months, they should receive most of that sun in the morning, with
            afternoon shade providing relief from the heat; this will prevent the flowers from wilting during the hottest
            part of the day. In the winter, the sun may not provide as much heat, therefore the cone flower may benefit
            from more afternoon sun.</p>

        <p><strong>Pruning:</strong> Coneflower (Echinacea 'Tomato Soup') should be pruned in the early to mid spring. It
            is best to prune just after flowering has finished so no flower buds are removed before they have a chance
            to open. Remove faded flower heads and any dead or broken stems. Pruning time should be kept to a minimum -
            no more than a quarter of the foliage should be removed in any 1 season to prevent stressing the plant.</p>
